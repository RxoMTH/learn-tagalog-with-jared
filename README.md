# learn-tagalog-with-jared

This is a site for learning Tagalog/Filipino through the videos uploaded by Jared Hartmann on different social media platforms, namely Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.  
Beside every video are subtitles that show words used either by Jared or the people he's talking to.  
This site was born out of foreigners' interest for Tagalog subtitles in Jared's videos, in order to help them learn the language.

**NOTE:** As of this writing, the site is yet to embed videos and add subtitles.
